### Sample slide

::: {.columns align=center}

::: {.column width=65%}
#### Left column

This slide has two columns. They don't always have to have columns. It also has a titled block of content in the left column. Make sure you've always got a `::: notes` block after the slide content, even if it has no content.
:::

::: {.column width=35%}
Use `#` and `##` headers in the Markdown file to make level-1 and level-2 headings, `###` headers to make slide titles, and `####` to make block titles.
